Each player selects their Order at the start of the game.

Each Order will have a unique unit which may be summoned for battle and will remain in play for X number of turns until it is banished. Each order may also have unique powers that can be utilised through the use of the Worship currency, where those unique powers would lend themselves to the type of Order/god that can use them. E.g. A bird based Order (see below) may be able to call upon a flock of birds to spy distant areas of the map, revealing those map tiles and temporarily removing their fog of war.

~~Each order will have unique skins for units, towns and tile improvements.~~

Each Order may be represented by a different 'clade', and each clade may offer unique gameplay strengths and weaknesses, allowing for unique playstyles. Each unit within the clade may be represented by a different species within the clade, allowing for the unit to be represented by an animal/creature that best represents that unit's strengths.

The different species could be:
* Cat - Tiger, lion, panther. Increased speed but reduced power?
* Bear - Grizzly, brown, panda. Greatly increased power but greatly reduced speed?
* Human - perhaps humans also exist in this world?! Balanced speed and power?
* Insectoid - Mantis (swordsman), and... other stuff, possibly completely made up. Increased power but decreased speed?
* Bird - Hawk, sparrow, cassowary (shout out to Aus!)? Greatly increased speed but greatly decreased power?

Each order could also have a completely unique and complimentary style in their armour, buildings, tile improvements, etc.

The different styles could be:
* Medieval (I'm thinking human)
* Steampunk (bear)
* Futuristic medieval (cat)
* Light Magic (blue crystal?) (bird)
* Demonic magic (insect)
