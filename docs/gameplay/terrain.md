# Terrain

The terrain is a hex grid, viewed in isometric from the south.

Terrain consists of water and land tiles.

Land tiles can be in 1 of **(?)** levels of elevation. Refer to Unit Movement, Towns, Prayer Powers, and Combat pages for more info on the affects of elevation.

River and Road features are mutually exclusive when entering or existing the same edge of a tile. When rivers and roads cross, a bridge is automatically generated.
