##Tiger Prompt:

I'd like to draw an image of a character. The character is a humanoid tiger. They are an archer, carrying a bow, with a quiver of arrows on their back. They are dressed in armour, which is styled on traditional medieval, but appears slightly futuristic. Their bow is also slightly futuristic in design. The style is cute anime, with a slightly enlarged head and facial features, making it look approachable instead of intimidating. The background is completely white, I only want the character to be drawn.

##Favourite village prompt (non-futuristic):

"Medieval peasant settlement cluster in 24-degree dimetric axonometric projection, multiple small buildings arranged as a tiny village. Collection of 3-5 miniature structures: simple wooden cottages, small stone workshops, tiny barn, maybe a well or watchtower. Each building very small scale, suitable for representing an entire settlement on a single game hex tile.

NO BASE, NO GROUND, NO HEX PLATFORM - buildings should float on transparent background with no terrain beneath them. Buildings only, no landscape elements.

Medieval aesthetic: rough timber frames, thatched roofs, stone foundations, wattle and daub walls. Weathered browns, grays, straw colors. Rustic, early settlement appearance with basic craftsmanship.

Technical requirements: 24° dimetric axonometric projection (shallow angle, both horizontal axes at 24 degrees), clean game asset style, completely transparent background, no shadows extending beyond building footprints, consistent top-left lighting. Settlement cluster should fit within a hexagonal boundary when placed on game board.

Style: Hand-painted strategy game art, miniature scale buildings, earthy medieval palette, buildings clustered together to suggest a small hamlet or early town district."
