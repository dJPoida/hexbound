I'd like to draw an image of a character. The character is a humanoid tiger. They are an archer, carrying a bow, with a quiver of arrows on their back. They are dressed in armour, which is styled on traditional medieval, but appears slightly futuristic. Their bow is also slightly futuristic in design. The style is cute anime, with a slightly enlarged head and facial features, making it look approachable instead of intimidating. The background is completely white, I only want the character to be drawn.
