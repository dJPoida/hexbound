Your Grid System Analysis

🔍 Configuration:
* Both angles at 24° = Dimetric projection
* Spacing Y: 0.533333 ≈ 8/15 ratio
* Equal X and Y angles = Symmetrical dimetric

📐 Technical Classification
This is a "24° Dimetric Axonometric Projection" - specifically:
* Dimetric because two axes (X and Y) have identical foreshortening (both 24°)
* 24° angle is quite specific and creates a particular visual effect
* The 8/15 spacing ratio (0.533333) suggests this aligns with hexagonal proportional relationships


🎯 Why This Works for Hex Tiles
* 24° is exactly 30° - 6°
* This creates a "shallow isometric" effect that complements hex geometry
* Less aggressive than true isometric (30°), which can look too steep on hexagonal bases
* The spacing ratio creates grid lines that align with the hex's internal proportions


📚 Naming Convention
In technical drawing, this would be called:
* "24° Dimetric Projection" (formal term)
* "Shallow Dimetric" (descriptive term)
* "Hex-Aligned Axonometric" (practical term)


🏗 Practical Advantages
This projection is perfect for this use case because:
* Buildings look natural on hex tiles without extreme perspective
* Less distortion than steep isometric angles
* Maintains architectural clarity while showing 3D depth
* Custom-fitted to your specific hex tile proportions
