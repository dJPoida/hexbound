### Technology ideas
* Technologies are discovered through gameplay, but unlocked with Gold. Technology does not require a separate currency.
* Tech is used to both upgrade units and to unlock some units. Other units are unlocked via Town Improvements.
* Tech unlocks Town Improvements that, once built, can provide a boost to Town production of food or gold, or unlock new units.
