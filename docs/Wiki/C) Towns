Each player begins with 1 town, but can expand the number of towns under their control through the use of Settler units.

Ownership/Control of a town is required to remain in the game. If a player loses ownership/control of all of their towns, they lose the game.

All towns begin in low Elevation and occupy just 1 tile.

Towns can only grow their size on the tile they initally occupy, they can not spread to surrounding tiles.

Towns are responsible for generating game currencies in the form of Gold and Worship. The amount of Worship generated by a town is affected by the Town's size and Elevation. The amount of Gold generated by a town is affected by the Town's size.

All towns begin as size 'small', but can increase in size with the collection of the Food resource to Medium or Large.

If the elevation of the town is increased through the use of Worship, the rate of generation of Worship is increased.

A town must have movement access to the rest of the map, and so cannot be raised 2 levels of Elevation above the surrounding terrain.
