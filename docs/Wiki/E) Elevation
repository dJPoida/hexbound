Land tiles can be at 1 of 3 levels of Elevation; Low, Medium and High.

Do all land tiles on the map begin at Low Elevation? Might depend on whether the player can settle new Towns, which would mean higher Elevation tiles would be more desirable and would create competition to secure them. See below.

Elevation has an effect on several areas of gameplay:

1) Prayer Power - The higher the elevation of a Town, the greater the rate of generation of Prayer Power.
2) Unit Movement - Units can only move freely between tiles of Elevation that are either the same hight, or +/-1 in height. Units therefore cannot move between a difference in Elevation of 2 (e.g. between Low and High).
3) Unit Combat - Ranged units can shoot further based on the level of Elevation on which they sit. Melee units on higher ground gain offensive/defensive boosts.
4) Line of sight - Units on higher levels of Elevation can see further, removing a larger area of the Fog of War.
