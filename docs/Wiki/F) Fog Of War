Does what it says on the label. It's Fog of War.

Unexplored regions of the map are completely black.

Explored regions of the map that are no longer within sight of a friendly unit or town maintain visibility of the terrain, but do not maintain visibility of enemy units.

Explored regions covered by Fog of War can have the fog temorarily removed through the use of Prayer Power.
